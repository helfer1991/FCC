            <p>Ayrton Senna was not only one of the best F1 racing drivers of all time, but also a philantropist.</p>
            <p class="Senna-desc">Senna's won 3 F1 driver championships with McLaren-Honda. In 1994 he switched to Williams, having died on the fourth GP of that season at Imola (San Marino).</p>

            <h2>Considered by many fellow drivers as a model of competitiveness and ruthlessness inside the cockpit, outside of it he was an incredibly kind human being, helping many people (especially his brazillian compatriots) overcoming their needs.</h2>
            <h2>Senna had a tough rivalry with his fellow brazillian racing driver Nelson Piquet, but arguably his main rival was the french Alain Prost, with whom he had the fiercest rivalry ever known to the F1 world.</h2>

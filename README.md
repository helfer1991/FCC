# FCC
FCC project using HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a tribute page to a person (alive or dead). My pick was Ayrton Senna da Silva, the deceased F1 racing driver.

As a beginner in html and CSS this is a basic project that required tons of research, especially when it comes to the styling part.
It enabled me to learn a bit about CSS grid and many other parts of styling.

### There's a problem with the Media Queries used in an attempt to make this website responsive, so it needs some refactoring.
